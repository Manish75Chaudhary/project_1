This is a simple, interactive calculator built with Python that runs in the terminal. It performs basic arithmetic operations and includes an ASCII art logo to give a fun, retro feel.

📋 Description
This calculator allows users to:

Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)

Continuously calculate using the previous result

Restart the calculation at any time

The calculator is implemented using Python functions and a dictionary to map operators to their respective functions. It uses a loop to manage repeated calculations and recursion to restart the program.

⚙️ Features
✔️ Clean and beginner-friendly Python code

✔️ Reusable functions for each operation

✔️ Dictionary-based operation selection

✔️ ASCII Art logo for a creative terminal display

✔️ Input handling for continuous calculations

🧠 How It Works
The user is prompted to enter the first number.

The calculator displays available operators: +, -, *, /.

The user selects an operation and enters the next number.

The result is calculated and displayed.

The user is asked whether they want to continue using the current result or start a new calculation.

If "yes", the calculator continues using the result; if "no", the screen clears and the calculator restarts.
